Application Programming Interface (API)
- an API is the part of the server responsible for receiving request and sending response

Rest API
	- Representation State Transfer. It is an architectural style for cumminication between application.

What problem does it solve?
	The need to separate user interface concerns of the client from the data storage concerns of the server.

	Enables a decoupled server which can understand, process and respod client request without knowing the client state

In REST, our request has all of the information that needs from out client

	A REST API request:
		it is usually dictated by the HTTP method. Through an HTTP method the action needed to be done is detremined.
		A request contains additional information about the request: Headers

		A body which contains data that needs to be sent to a server.
		We can operatea and access resources through URL patch in a REST API, all the server needs from the client is already in the request and all a cliet needs from the server is in the response.

Postman
	It is a testing tool to test API endpoint and routes. It is a client with which we can create request from and receive our server/API
